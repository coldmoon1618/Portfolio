                        * If this particle is track-based, then this is the

                        cluster in GSIM (stored in deltaL of ECL cluster
                        object).
                        Belle analysis typically used clusters with quality == 0
                        in their :math:`E_{\text{extra ECL}}` (Belle only).
goodBelleGamma          
                        [Legacy] Returns 1.0 if photon candidate passes simple
                        region dependent
                        energy selection for Belle data and MC (50/100/150 MeV).
goodBelleKshort         
                        [Legacy] GoodKs Returns 1.0 if a

                        algorithm:

                        impact parameter of, and
                        angle between the daughter pions as well as separation
                        from the vertex and
                        flight distance in the transverse plane.
goodBelleLambda         
                        [Legacy] Returns 2.0, 1.0, 0.0 as an indication of
                        goodness of :math:`\Lambda^0` candidates,
                        based on:

                            * The distance of the two daughter tracks at their
                        interception at z axis,
                            * the minimum distance of the daughter tracks and
                        the IP in xy plane,
                            * the difference of the azimuthal angle of the
                        vertex vector and the momentum vector,
                            * and the flight distance of the Lambda0 candidates
                        in xy plane.

                        It reproduces the ``goodLambda()`` function in Belle.

                        ``goodBelleLambda`` selection 1 (selected with:
                        ``goodBelleLambda>0``) should be used with
                        ``atcPIDBelle(4,2) > 0.6``,
                        and ``goodBelleLambda`` selecton 2
                        (``goodBelleLambda>1``) can be used without a proton PID
                        cut.
                        The former cut is looser than the latter.".

                        suppression. If only the variable is specified, the
                        CleoCones are calculated from all final state particles.
                        If string is set to 'ROE', the CleoCones are calculated

                        the reconstructed B candidate, if mode is set to ROE it
                        will use the ROE thrust axis.
                        If mode is set to Auto the function use the thrust axis
                        based on isInRestOfEvent(particle).

                        | A cluster comprises the energy depositions of several
                        crystals. All these crystals have slightly
                          different orientations in space. A shower direction
                        can be constructed by calculating the weighted
                          average of these orientations using the corresponding
                        energy depositions as weights. The intersection

                        vector with this direction originating from the
                          cluster center and an extrapolated track can be used
                        as reference for the calculation of the shower
                          depth. It is defined as the distance between this
                        intersection and the cluster center.

clusterE                
                        Returns ECL cluster's energy corrected for leakage and
                        background.

                        The raw photon energy is given by the weighted sum of
                        all ECL crystal energies within the ECL cluster.
                        The weights per crystals are :math:`\leq 1` after
                        cluster energy splitting in the case of overlapping
                        clusters. The number of crystals that are included in
                        the sum depends on a initial energy estimation
                        and local beam background levels at the highest energy
                        crystal position. It is optimized to minimize
                        the core width (resolution) of true photons. Photon
                        energy distributions always show a low energy tail
                        due to unavoidable longitudinal and transverse leakage
                        that can be further modified by the clustering
                        algorithm and beam backgrounds.The peak position of the
                        photon energy distributions are corrected to
                        match the true photon energy in MC:

                            - Leakage correction: Using large MC samples of
                        mono-energetic single photons, a correction factor
                              :math:`f` as function of reconstructed detector
                        position, reconstructed photon energy and beam
                        backgrounds
                              is determined via :math:`f =
                        \frac{\text{peak_reconstructed}}{\text{energy_true}}`.

                            - Cluster energy calibration (data only): To reach
                        the target precision of :math:`< 1.8\%` energy
                              resolution for high energetic photons, the
                        remaining difference between MC and data must be
                        calibrated
                              using kinematically fit muon pairs. This
                        calibration is only applied to data and not to MC and
                        will
                              take time to develop.

                        It is important to note that after perfect leakage
                        correction and cluster energy calibration,
                        the :math:`\pi^{0}` mass peak will be shifted slightly
                        to smaller values than the PDG average
                        due to the low energy tails of photons. The
                        :math:`\pi^{0}` mass peak must not be corrected
                        to the PDG value by adjusting the reconstructed photon
                        energies. Selection criteria based on
                        the mass for :math:`\pi^{0}` candidates must be based on
                        the biased value. Most analysis
                        will used mass constrained :math:`\pi^{0}` s anyhow.

                        The photon timing uncertainty is currently determined
                        using MC. The resulting parametrization depends on
                        the true energy deposition in the highest energetic
                        crystal and the local beam background level in that
                        crystal.
                        The resulting timing distribution is non-Gaussian and
                        for each photon the value dt99 is stored,
                        where :math:`|\text{timing}| / \text{dt99} < 1` is
                        designed to give a :math:`99\%`
                        timing efficiency for true photons from the IP.
                        The resulting efficiency is approximately flat in energy
                        and independent of beam background levels.

                        Very large values of dt99 are an indication of failed
                        waveform fits in the ECL.
                        We remove such clusters in most physics photon lists.

clusterSecondMoment     
                        Returns second moment :math:`S`. It is defined as:

                        .. math::
                            S = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n} w_{i} E_{i}
                        r^2_{i}}{\sum_{i=0}^{n} w_{i} E_{i}}

                        where :math:`E_{i} = (E_0, E_1, ...)` are the single
                        crystal energies sorted by energy, :math:`w_{i}` is
                        the crystal weight, and :math:`r_{i}` is the distance of
                        the :math:`i`-th digit to the shower center projected
                        to a plane perpendicular to the shower axis.

clusterTheta            
                        Returns ECL cluster's polar angle :math:`\theta`
                        (this is not generally equal to a photon polar angle).

                        | The direction of a cluster is given by the connecting
                        line of :math:`\,(0,0,0)\,` and
                          cluster centroid position in the ECL.
                        | The cluster centroid position is calculated using up
                        to 21 crystals (5x5 excluding corners)
                          after cluster energy splitting in the case of
                        overlapping clusters.
                        | The centroid position is the logarithmically weighted
                        average of all crystals evaluated at
                          the crystal centers. Cluster centroids are generally
                        biased towards the centers of the
                          highest energetic crystal. This effect is larger for
                        low energetic photons.
                        | Beam backgrounds slightly decrease the position
                        resolution, mainly for low energetic photons.

                        .. note::
                            Radius of a cluster is almost constant in the barrel
                        and should not be used directly in any selection.

                        Unlike for charged tracks, the uncertainty (covariance)
                        of the photon directions is not determined
                        based on individual cluster properties but taken from on
                        MC-based parametrizations of the resolution
                        as function of true photon energy, true photon direction
                        and beam background level.

clusterTiming           
                        Returns the time of the ECL cluster. It is calculated as
                        the Photon timing minus the Event t0.
                        Photon timing is given by the fitted time of the
                        recorded waveform of the highest energy crystal in the
                        cluster. After all calibrations and corrections
                        (including Time-Of-Flight), photons from the interaction
                        point (IP) should have a Photon timing that corresponds
                        to the Event t0, :math:`t_{0}`.  The Event t0 is the
                        time of the event and may be measured by a different
                        sub-detector (see Event t0 documentation). For an ECL
                        cluster produced at the interation point in time with
                        the event, the cluster time should be consistent with
                        zero
                        within the uncertainties. Special values are returned if
                        the fit for the Photon timing fails (see
                        documentation for `clusterHasFailedTiming`). (For MC,
                        the calibrations and corrections are not fully
                        simulated).

clusterTrackMatch       
                        Returns 1.0 if at least one reconstructed charged track
                        is matched to the ECL cluster.

                        Every reconstructed charged track is extrapolated into
                        the ECL.
                        Every ECL crystal that is crossed by the track
                        extrapolation is marked.
                        Each ECL cluster that contains any marked crystal is
                        matched to the track.
                        Multiple tracks can be matched to one cluster and
                        multiple clusters can be matched to one track.
                        It is conceptually correct to have two tracks matched to
                        the same cluster.
clusterZernikeMVA       
                        Returns output of a MVA using eleven Zernike moments of
                        the cluster. Zernike moments are calculated per
                        shower in a plane perpendicular to the shower direction
                        via

                        .. math::

                        w_{i} E_{i} \right|

                        where n, m are the integers, :math:`i` runs over the
                        crystals in the shower,
                        :math:`E_{i}` is the energy of the i-th crystal in the
                        shower,
                        :math:`R_{nm}` is a polynomial of degree :math:`n`,
                        :math:`\rho_{i}` is the radial distance of the
                        :math:`i`-th crystal in the perpendicular plane,
                        and :math:`\alpha_{i}` is the polar angle of the
                        :math:`i`-th crystal in the perpendicular plane.
                        As a crystal can be related to more than one shower,
                        :math:`w_{i}` is the fraction of the
                        energy of the :math:`i`-th crystal associated with the
                        shower.

                        the clusters (neutrals) and matched clusters (charged)
                        of daughters (of all generations) of the provided

minC2TDist              
                        Returns distance between ECL cluster and nearest track
                        hitting the ECL.

                        A cluster comprises the energy depositions of several
                        crystals. All these crystals have slightly
                        different orientations in space. A shower direction can
                        be constructed by calculating the weighted
                        average of these orientations using the corresponding
                        energy depositions as weights. The intersection
                        (more precisely the point of closest approach) of the
                        vector with this direction originating from the
                        cluster center and an extrapolated track can be used as
                        reference for the calculation of the track depth.
                        It is defined as the distance between this intersection
                        and the track hit position on the front face of the ECL.

                        .. note::
                            This distance is calculated on the reconstructed

                                              Cosine of the acoplanarity angle
                        (:math:`\Phi` in the `PDG Polarization Review
                        <http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/reviews/rpp2018-rev-b-decays-

                                              Given a two-body decay, the
                        acoplanarity angle is defined as
                                              the angle between the two decay
                        planes in the reference frame of the mother.

                                              We calculate the acoplanarity
                        angle as the angle between the two
                                              normal vectors of the decay
                        planes. Each normal vector is the cross product of the
                        momentum of one daughter (in the frame of the mother)
                        and the
                                              momentum of one of the
                        granddaughters (in the reference frame of the daughter).

                                              This variable needs two integer
                        arguments: the first one, ``i`` is the index of the
                        first granddaughter, and the second one, ``j`` the index
                        of the
                                              second granddaughter.

                                              For example, in the decay
                        :math:`B^0 \to \left(J/\psi \to \mu^+ \mu^-\right)
                        \left(K^{*0} \to K^+ \pi^-\right)`, if the provided
                        particle is :math:`B^0` and the selected indices are (0,
                        0),
                                              the variable will return the
                        acoplanarity using the :math:`\mu^+` and the :math:`K^+`
                        granddaughters.
cosHelicityAngle(i, j)  
                                              Cosine of the helicity angle
                        between the momentum of the provided particle and the
                        momentum of the selected granddaughter
                                              in the reference frame of the
                        selected daughter (:math:`\theta_1` and :math:`\theta_2`

                                              `PDG <https://journals.aps.org/prd

                                              This variable needs two integer
                        arguments: the first one, ``i``, is the index of the
                        daughter and the second one, ``j`` is the index of the
                        granddaughter.

                                              For example, in the decay
                        :math:`B^0 \to \left(J/\psi \to \mu^+ \mu^-\right)
                        \left(K^{*0} \to K^+ \pi^-\right)`,
                                              if the provided particle is
                        :math:`B^0` and the selected indices are (0, 0),
                                              the variable will return the angle
                        between the momentum of the :math:`B^0` and the momentum
                        of the :math:`\mu^+`,
                                              both momenta in the rest frame of
                        the :math:`J/\psi`.

                                              This variable is needed for
                        angular analyses of :math:`B`-meson decays into two
                        vector particles.

                                              assuming that the mother of the
                        provided particle corresponds to the centre-of-mass
                        system, whose parameters are

                        function, given the accelerator's conditions.

                                              Cosine of the helicity angle of
                        the i-th daughter (see
                        ``Particle::getCosHelicityDaughter``).

                        the index of the granddaughter that defines the angle,
                        default is 0.

                                              For example, in the decay:
                        :math:`B^0 \to \left(J/\psi \to \mu^+ \mu^-\right)
                        \left(K^{*0} \to K^+ \pi^-\right)`, if the provided
                        particle is :math:`B^0` and the selected index is 0,
                                              the variable will return the
                        helicity angle of the :math:`\mu^+`.
                                              If the selected index is 1 the
                        variable will return the helicity angle of the
                        :math:`K^+` (defined via the rest frame of the
                        :math:`K^{*0}`).
                                              In rare cases if one wanted the
                        helicity angle of the second granddaughter, indices 1,1
                        would return the helicity angle of the :math:`\pi^-`).

abs(variable)           Returns absolute value of the given variable.
                        E.g. abs(mcPDG) returns the absolute value of the mcPDG,
                        which is often useful for cuts.
angleToClosestInList(particleListName) Returns the angle between this particle
                        and the closest particle (smallest opening angle) in the
                        list provided.

conditionalVariableSelector(cut, variableIfTrue, variableIfFalse) Returns one of
                        the two supplied variables, depending on whether the
                        particle passes the supplied cut.
                        The first variable is returned if the particle passes
                        the cut, and the second variable is returned otherwise.
cos(variable)           Returns cos value of the given variable.
                        E.g. sin(?) returns the cosine of the value of the

countInList(particleList, cut='') Returns number of particle which pass given in
                        cut in the specified particle list.

                        particles in a list.
                        E.g. countInList(e+, isSignal == 1) returns the number
                        of correctly reconstructed electrons in the event.
                        The variable is event-based and does not need a valid
                        particle pointer as input.

                        belonging to the same decay tree.
                        The particles are identified via generalized daughter
                        indexes, which are simply colon-separated lists of
                        daughter indexes, ordered starting from the root
                        particle. For example, ``0:1:3``  identifies the fourth
                        daughter (3) of the second daughter (1) of the first
                        daughter (0) of the mother particle. ``1`` simply
                        identifies the second daughter of the root particle.

                        Both two and three generalized indexes can be given to
                        ``daughterAngleInBetween``. If two indices are given,
                        the variable returns the angle between the momenta of
                        the two given particles. If three indices are given,

                        the third particle and a vector which is the sum of the
                        first two daughter momenta.

                        .. tip::
                            ``daughterAngleInBetween(0, 3)`` will return the
                        angle between the first and fourth daughter.
                            ``daughterAngleInBetween(0, 1, 3)`` will return the
                        angle between the fourth daughter and the sum of the
                        first and second daughter.
                            ``daughterAngleInBetween(0:0, 3:0)`` will return the
                        angle between the first daughter of the first daughter,
                        and the first daughter of the fourth daughter

                        the clusters associated to the two given daughters.If
                        three indices given: returns the angle between the
                        momentum of the third particle's cluster and a vector
                        which is the sum of the first two daughter's cluster
                        momenta.Returns nan if any of the daughters specified
                        don't have an associated cluster.The arguments in the
                        argument vector must be integers corresponding to the
                        ith and jth (and kth) daughters.
daughterCombination(variable, daughterIndex_1, daughterIndex_2 ... daughterIndex_n) 
                        Returns a ``variable`` function only of the 4-momentum
                        calculated on an arbitrary set of (grand)daughters.

                        .. warning::
                            ``variable`` can only be a function of the
                        daughters' 4-momenta.

                        Daughters from different generations of the decay tree
                        can be combined using generalized daughter indexes,
                        which are simply colon-separated
                        the list of daughter indexes, starting from the root
                        particle: for example, ``0:1:3``  identifies the fourth
                        daughter (3) of the second daughter (1) of the first
                        daughter (0) of the mother particle.

                        .. tip::
                            ``daughterCombination(M, 0, 3, 4)`` will return the
                        invariant mass of the system made of the first, fourth

                        of the first daughter and the first daughter of the
                        fourth daughter.

                        the rest frame of the given particle.
                        (That means that it returns p_j - p_i)
                        Nota Bene: for the particular case 'variable=phi' you
                        should use the 'daughterDiffOfPhi' function.

                        ECLClusters of two given daughters.
                        The difference is signed and takes account of the

                        are addition (``+``),
                        subtraction (``-``), multiplication (``*``), division
                        (``/``) and power (``^``
                        or ``**``). Parenthesis can be in the form of square
                        brackets ``[v1 * v2]``
                        or normal brackets ``(v1 * v2)``. It will work also with
                        variables taking
                        arguments. Operator precedence is taken into account.
                        For example ::

                            (daughter(0, E) + daughter(1, E))**2 - p**2 + 0.138

                        .. versionchanged:: release-03-00-00
                           now both, ``[]`` and ``()`` can be used for grouping
                        operations, ``**`` can
                           be used for exponent and float literals are possible
                        directly in the
                           formula.
genParticle(index, variable) 
                        [Eventbased] Returns the ``variable`` for the ith
                        generator particle.
                        The arguments of the function must be the ``index`` of
                        the particle in the MCParticle Array,
                        and ``variable``, the name of the function or variable
                        for that generator particle.
                        If ``index`` goes beyond the length of the MCParticles
                        array, NaN will be returned.

                        E.g. ``genParticle(0, p)`` returns the total momentum of
                        the first MCParticle, which is
                        the Upsilon(4S) in a generic decay.
                        ``genParticle(0, mcDaughter(1, p)`` returns the total
                        momentum of the second daughter of
                        the first MC Particle, which is the momentum of the
                        second B meson in a generic decay.
genUpsilon4S(variable)  
                        [Eventbased] Returns the ``variable`` evaluated for the
                        generator-level :math:`\Upsilon(4S)`.
                        If no generator level :math:`\Upsilon(4S)` exists for
                        the event, NaN will be returned.

                        E.g. ``genUpsilon4S(p)`` returns the total momentum of
                        the :math:`\Upsilon(4S)` in a generic decay.
                        ``genUpsilon4S(mcDaughter(1, p)`` returns the total

                        accessing daughters of the particle.
                        E.g. matchedMC(p) returns the total momentum of the

                        daughter does not exist.
                        E.g. mcDaughter(0, PDG) will return the PDG code of the
                        first MC daughter of the matched MCparticle of the
                        reconstructed particle the function is applied to./nThe

                        particle the function is applied to.
                        The meta variable can also be nested:

                        daughters' 4-momenta.
                            This means that if you made a kinematic fit without
                        updating the daughters' momenta, the result of this

                        (yet!): this variable can be used only on first-
                        generation daughters.

                        .. tip::
                            ``useAlternativeDaughterHypothesis(M, 0:K+, 2:pi-)``
                        will return the invariant mass of the particle assuming
                        that the first daughter is a kaon and the third is a
                        pion, instead of whatever was used in reconstructing the
                        decay.
                            ``useAlternativeDaughterHypothesis(mRecoil, 1:p+)``
                        will return the recoil mass of the particle assuming
                        that the second daughter is a proton instead of whatever
                        was used in reconstructing the decay.

useCMSFrame(variable)   Returns the value of the variable using the CMS frame as
                        current reference frame.
                        E.g. useCMSFrame(E) returns the energy of a particle in
                        the CMS frame.
useLabFrame(variable)   
                        Returns the value of ``variable`` in the *lab* frame.

                        .. tip::
                            The lab frame is the default reference frame,
                        usually you don't need to use this meta-variable.
                            E.g. ``useLabFrame(E)`` returns the energy of a
                        particle in the Lab frame, same as just ``E``.

                        Specifying the lab frame is useful in some corner-cases.
                        For example:
                        ``useRestFrame(daughter(0, formula(E -
                        useLabFrame(E))))`` which is the difference of the first
                        daughter's energy in the rest frame of the mother
                        (current particle) with the same daughter's lab-frame
                        energy.
useRestFrame(variable)  Returns the value of the variable using the rest frame
                        of the given particle as current reference frame.
                        E.g. useRestFrame(daughter(0, p)) returns the total
                        momentum of the first daughter in its mother's rest-
                        frame
useTagSideRecoilRestFrame(variable, daughterIndexTagB) Returns the value of the
                        variable in the rest frame of the recoiling particle to
                        the tag side B meson.
                        The variable should only be applied to an Upsilon(4S)
                        list.
                        E.g. ``useTagSideRecoilRestFrame(daughter(1, daughter(1,
                        p)), 0)`` applied on a Upsilon(4S) list
                        (``Upsilon(4S)->B+:tag B-:sig``) returns the momentum of
                        the second daughter of the signal B meson in the signal
                        B meson rest frame.
varFor(pdgCode, variable) Returns the value of the variable for the given
                        particle if its abs(pdgCode) agrees with the given one.
                        E.g. varFor(11, p) returns the momentum if the particle
                        is an electron or a positron.
varForFirstMCAncestorOfType(type, variable) Returns requested variable of the
                        first ancestor of the given type.
                        Ancestor type can be set up by PDG code or by particle
                        name (check evt.pdl for valid particle names)
varForMCGen(variable)   Returns the value of the variable for the given particle
                        if the MC particle related to it is primary, not
                        virtual, and not initial.
                        If no MC particle is related to the given particle, or
                        the MC particle is not primary, virtual, or initial, NaN
                        will be returned.
                        E.g. varForMCGen(PDG) returns the PDG code of the MC
                        particle related to the given particle if it is primary,
                        not virtual, and not initial.
veto(particleList, cut, pdgCode = 11) Combines current particle with particles
                        from the given particle list and returns 1 if the
                        combination passes the provided cut.
                        For instance one can apply this function on a signal
                        Photon and provide a list of all photons in the rest of
                        event and a cut
                        around the neutral Pion mass (e.g. 0.130 < M < 0.140).
                        If a combination of the signal Photon with a ROE photon
                        fits this criteria, hence looks like a neutral pion, the
                        veto-Metavariable will return 1

                                 Miscellaneous

azimuthalAngleInDecayPlane(i, j) 
                                              Azimuthal angle of i-th daughter
                        in decay plane towards projection of particle momentum
                        into decay plane.

                                              First we define the following
                        symbols:

                                              * P: four-momentum vector of
                        decaying particle in whose decay plane the azimuthal
                        angle is measured
                                              * M: "mother" of p, however not
                        necessarily the direct mother but any higher state, here
                        the CMS itself is chosen
                                              * D1: daughter for which the
                        azimuthal angle is supposed to be calculated
                                              * D2: another daughter needed to
                        span the decay plane
                                              * L: normal to the decay plane
                        (four-component vector)

                                              L can be defined via the following
                        relation:

                                              .. math:: L^{\sigma} =
                        \delta^{\sigma\nu} \epsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}
                        P^{\mu}D1^{\alpha}D2^{\beta}

                                              The azimuthal angle is given by

                                              .. math:: \phi \equiv \cos^{-1}
                        \left(\frac{-\vec{M_{\parallel}} \cdot
                        \vec{D1}}{|\vec{M_{\parallel}}| \cdot |\vec{D1}|}\right)

                                              For a frame independent
