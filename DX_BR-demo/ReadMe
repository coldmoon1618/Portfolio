Utility:

    toolkit/

        Scripts used throughout analysis

        Import_py/
            [Sort of hisotircal now as subdirs diverge, might entralize again later]

            buildVars.py
            Build basf2 variable lists for all reco objects

            BuildRunReco.py
            Build bsub commands to run over MC files of different types

        include_Cpp/
            [Sort of hisotircal now as subdirs diverge, might entralize again later]

            My*.h
            Header files of custom defined structs
            rootlogon.C
            Usage: ln -s ~/thisDir/rootlogon anaDir/. for ROOT to pick the path

            SaveSingleCand.C
            Select single best candidate per event after cuts

        GRID_tools/
            Convenient scripts to interact with GRID
            Copied from BphiKs ana and need updates
            TO-DO: include some new examples with skipped indices

        b2variables/
            $basf2 variables.py dump for each version

        data_bsub/
            Setup to run over KEKCC data

        py_examples/
            Other py examples, see Tag_side_reco/past_MC_attempts/failedMC for context
Analysis:

    TO-DO: Might need to update good MC14 list to include all 1iab of files
            or maybe only do that once we move to the signal side

    Tag_side_reco/

        Initial tag side reco study
        Objectives: clean and precise reconstruction for the tag side B+

        Workflow:
            Reco_xx.py          : event-based ntuple using basf2
            SaveSingleCand.C    : choose single best candidate per event
            SaveModeFiles.C     : save single best candidate into mode-specific files
