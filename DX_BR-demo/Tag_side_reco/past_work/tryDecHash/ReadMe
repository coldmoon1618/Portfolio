Starting point of using decayHash, more continued ../hashtagMC14

Might eventually do a central dir that all deal with decayHash
But right now let's start building things little by little 

Reco_MC.py
    The basf2 script that saves 4 types of outputs:

    charged_0_mainOut.root
        Regular single candidate per event output, ignore this for now for the purpose of truth tracing
    charged_0_feiHash.root
        The decay chain FEI thinks it is reconstructing
    charged_0_mc1Hash.root
        The MC truth decay chain of B+ 
    charged_0_mc2Hash.root
        The MC truth decay chain of B- 

readHash.py
    Reads in the .root files from the above, and prints out info to out.txt

printTree.py 
    Shows example usage of Belle2.DecayTree() object of printing the a decay chain into tree
