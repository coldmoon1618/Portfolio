Using the same real data eventBased output Data_Rec.root

Then save single best candidate according to desired cuts.

    SaveRound1Cand.C
        No exclusion of any modes
    SaveRound2Cand.C
        Exclude the certainly bad channels
    SaveRound3Cand.C
        Exclude additional 'not sure' channels

Then locally, use PlotData.C and FitMbcBDTcut for each mode for these three stages
Expectation: Dropping the bad channels improve fitting
To check:    If dropping not sure channels improve fitting
